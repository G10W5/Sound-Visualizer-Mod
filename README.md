Choose the aesthetic that fits your playstyle:
*   **Chevron (Classic)**: Bold, pointed indicators for maximum visibility.

### Tactical Awareness

*   **Item Icons**: Automatically displays relevant icons (e.g., Zombie heads, Sword for hits, Boots for steps) next to indicators.
*   **Distance Scaling**: Indicators grow and fade naturally based on how close the sound is.
### Intelligent Filtering
